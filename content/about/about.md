## About Me {#about-me}

My name is Brandon Irizarry. I write about stuff that interests me
on this blog. That can, as is mandated by tradition, include
software and other tech-related projects I'm working on (or with),
but can come to include other hobbies as well, like playing
keyboard (and music in general.)
