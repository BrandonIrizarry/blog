My name is Brandon Irizarry. Here you'll find stuff about software
and other tech-related projects I'm either working on, or else
using, as well as thoughts on other hobbies, such as music.

I currently am brushing up on my piano skills, and am also an avid
classical music fan (mostly Baroque-to-Classical era; [[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwEx-3EdmA0YaWxqVt19sYYNSDaRL7MLe][the complete
string quartets of Haydn]] is a favorite of mine. My favorite
quartet, if I had to choose one, would be the Lark Quartet, Op. 64,
No. 5 in D.)

Mathematics is also a passing interest of mine, though I haven't
had time as of yet to pursue it in any great depth.
